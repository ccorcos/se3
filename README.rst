Special Euclidian 3-space (SE3)
===============================

Special euclidian 3-space is the world in which we live, dealing with 3D
position and orientation (so technically more than 3 dimensions, but
thats why its *special*).

The ``SE3`` class allows us to do typical transformations easily with
multiplication of the class instances, as well as visualize the
coordinate frame.
